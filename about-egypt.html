        <p class="text-center">
          Egypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its
          heritage back to the 6thâ€“4th millennia BCE. Considered a cradle of
          civilisation, Ancient Egypt saw some of the earliest developments of
          writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central
          government. Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great
          Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley
          of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of
          scientific and popular interest. Egypt's long and rich cultural
          heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which has
          endured, and often assimilated, various foreign influences, including
          Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, Ottoman Turkish, and Nubian. Egypt was an
          early and important centre of Christianity, but was largely Islamised
          in the seventh century and remains a predominantly Muslim country,
          albeit with a significant Christian minority. From the 16th to the
          beginning of the 20th century, Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial
          powers: The Ottoman Empire and the British Empire. Modern Egypt dates
          back to 1922, when it gained nominal independence from the British
          Empire as a monarchy. However, British military occupation of Egypt
          continued, and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an
          instrument of British colonialism. Following the 1952 revolution,
          Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British
          occupation, nationalized the British-held Suez Canal, exiled King
          Farouk and his family, and declared itself a republic. In 1958 it
          merged with Syria to form the United Arab Republic, which dissolved in
          1961. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Egypt endured
          social and religious strife and political instability, fighting
          several armed conflicts with Israel in 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and
          occupying the Gaza Strip intermittently until 1967. In 1978, Egypt
          signed the Camp David Accords, officially withdrawing from the Gaza
          Strip and recognising Israel. The country continues to face
          challenges, from political unrest, including the recent 2011
          revolution and its aftermath, to terrorism and economic
          underdevelopment. Egypt's current government is a semi-presidential
          republic headed by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, which has been
          described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian. Islam is the
          official religion of Egypt and Arabic is its official language. With
          over 95 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in
          North Africa, the Middle East, and the Arab world, the third-most
          populous in Africa , and the fifteenth-most populous in the world. The
          great majority of its people live near the banks of the Nile River, an
          area of about 40,000 square kilometres, where the only arable land is
          found. The large regions of the Sahara desert, which constitute most
          of Egypt's territory, are sparsely inhabited. About half of Egypt's
          residents live in urban areas, with most spread across the densely
          populated centres of greater Cairo, Alexandria and other major cities
          in the Nile Delta. The sovereign state of Egypt is a transcontinental
          country considered to be a regional power in North Africa, the Middle
          East and the Muslim world, and a middle power worldwide. Egypt's
          economy is one of the largest and most diversified in the Middle East,
          and is projected to become one of the largest in the world in the 21st
          century. In 2016, Egypt overtook South Africa and became Africa's
          second largest economy . Egypt is a founding member of the United
          Nations, Non-Aligned Movement, Arab League, African Union, and
          Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
